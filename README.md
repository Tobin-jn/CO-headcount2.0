# CO HeadCount2.0

CO Headcount2.0 takes in data pertaining to school districts in Colorado. The site looks at Kindergarten enrollment data and allows for comparisons over time. Users can search for a specific school district. Selections can be made to make a comparison between two districts. Selections are toggled on and off via a click.

### Future Iterations

By bringing in multiple types of data sets, users will be able to see varying categories of data as well as multiple options for deeper comparison.
